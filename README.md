ðŸŽ¤ Hi there, little QA part that speaks around my skills ðŸ‘‹ **
                                  
I love hunting for bugs in a software application, not to be negative nor disdain what developers have done, but to bring to their attentions areas where they have missed and most especially driving the product or solution to success and user-friendly usage. I also do like to keep software application simple, elegant and seamless usage by the end-users in solving their everyday need.

I'm currently working in the financial industry in Nigeria, where I am saddled with ensuring products and software solutions meets both functional and user requirements. I specialize in manual testing and expanding my skills in test automation.
I'm currently and always upscalling my skills in test automation for effectiveness, efficiency and delivery of software products and solutions as I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams within and outside my project squad.
