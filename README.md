### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github Profile**
                                       
A little bit about me, I love hunting for bugs in a software application, not to be negative nor disdain what developers have done, but to bring to their attentions areas where they have missed and most especially driving the product or solution to success. I also do like to keep software application simple, elegant and seamless usage by the end-users in solving their everyday need.

I'm currently working in the financial industry in Nigeria, where I am saddled with ensuring products and software solutions meets both functional and user requirements. I specialize in manual testing and expanding my skills in test automation.
I'm currently and always upscalling my skills in test automation for effectiveness, efficiency and delivery of software products and solutions as I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams within and outside my project squad.

**My Skills**

> Bug Hunter: to deliver a robust solution

> Automation Test (Web and Mobile)

>	Agile Methodology (Scrum)

>	API Test using Swagger or Postman

> Programming Language: Javascript and Python

> CI/CD: tool use is Jenkins

**Looking for reason to hire me**

My impulse for the delivery of Quality-User friendly software products, ideal organization skills and leadership skills to manage team members makes me an outstanding Engineer. Looking for an organization which will challenge my problem-solving skills and allow me to continue to develop my knowledge and potential and application of my over 5 years work experience as a Quality Assurance Engineer

**Fun Fact**

Play any brain tasking game, e.g Chess, adventure, Scarbble.
